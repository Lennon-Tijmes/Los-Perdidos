# Los-Perdidos

## Using the Robot
To use the robot, place it in the parking space with the color sensor facing the large black square, and the sensor should be just within the parking space.

Then, turn on both switches to start the robot. Subsequently, the robot will calibrate itself on the starting line and navigate through the maze.

## Features
The robot will have the following functions:

Start procedure: using a distance sensor to detect the previous robot and calibration
In the start procedure, an object must be picked up with the gripper
Line following using light sensors
Completing the maze using a sonar sensor
Making 90-degree turns to the left and right
Turns are executed using the sonar sensor and the position in the maze
At the end, the robot must drop its object onto another large black square (the finish)
